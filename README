After starting, enter the directory path. Does not take command line args because it seemed like a pain to put it into a usable string.

My main challenge was overthinking and not realizing the path that the function uses as an argument is literally a path that I could use to make nodes. Other problems were mostly dealing with dot syntax.

Because I didn't establish each node, the labels are on the arrows pointing to them instead, so graphs look slightly wonky.
